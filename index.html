                        Lasagna, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets. In Italian cuisine it is made of stacked layers of pasta 
                        alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and 
                        Parmesan), and seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which melts during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with 
                        the other ingredients and then baked in an oven (al forno). The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.

                        A pancake, also known as hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack, is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain 
                        eggs, milk, and butter, and then cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan. It is a type of batter bread.

                        A cookie is a baked snack or dessert that is typically small, flat, and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar, egg, and some type of oil, fat, or 
                        butter. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, or nuts.
